      In laboratory studies, young cattle are able to memorize the locations of
      several food sources and retain this memory for at least 8 hours, although
      this declined after 12 hours. Fifteen-month-old heifers learn more quickly
      than adult cows which have had either one or two calvings, but their
      longer-term memory is less stable. Mature cattle perform well in spatial
      learning tasks and have a good long-term memory in these tests. Cattle
      tested in a radial arm maze are able to remember the locations of
      high-quality food for at least 30 days. Although they initially learn to
      avoid low-quality food, this memory diminishes over the same duration.
